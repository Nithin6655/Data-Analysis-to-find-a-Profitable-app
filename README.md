# Data-Analysis-to-find-a-Profitable-app

# Context
Our company builds apps which are published in Google Playstore and Apple Appstores. The revenue is generated from in-app adds. We need to help figure out what type of app should the company build.

# Objective
Our aim in the project is to find out mobile app profiles that are profitable in app store and google play markets. We are working as data analyst for a company that builds mobile applications. And our goal is to help the developers with a data driven decision with respect to kind of app they build.

# Tools Used
Python

Python Lists & Dictionary

Jupyter Notebook

# Key Insights
We concluded that taking a popular book (perhaps a more recent book) and turning it into an app could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store markets. The markets are already full of libraries, so we need to add some special features besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes on the book, a forum where people can discuss the book, etc.
